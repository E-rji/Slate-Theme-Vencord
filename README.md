# Slate Theme for Vencord.
Not at all made by me but by these guys over here; https://betterdiscord.app/theme/Slate. 

This is just the downloadable version ported onto GitHub so you can use it in Vencord.
For my private use only, however if you are also looking for this then you can just use this repos.

If the Slate owners would like me to take this down, you can e-Mail me at: erjiffs@gmail.com.
No harm meant, I just really like your theme but it's not compatable with Vencord since it's not uploaded onto Github in a .css file.
